Slowproxy is a ruby script that allows you to do this: [http://xkcd.com/862/](http://xkcd.com/862/).

Using this script along with the proxy settings in your browser, you can
slow down the loading of "time-sink" websites like Reddit, Twitter and Hacker News.


Context: 

> After years of trying various methods, I broke this habit by pitting my impatience against my laziness. I decoupled the action and the neurological reward by setting up a simple 30-second delay I had to wait through, in which I couldn't do anything else, before any new page or chat client would load (and only allowed one to run at once). The urge to check all those sites magically vanished--and my 'productive' computer use was unaffected.

The proxy script was originally posted on [pastebin](http://pastebin.com/Et2TSZiF), which I found via this reddit [discussion](http://redd.it/fo276). Oh! the irony ;)
